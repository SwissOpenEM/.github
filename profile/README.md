The Open EM Data Network (OpenEM) is a consortium of Swiss electron microscopy facilities working together to:

Improve Open Research Data (ORD) practices in the Swiss EM community
Provide an open and FAIR repository for Swiss EM data not hosted elsewhere
Standardize EM metadata & automate collection at Swiss EM facilities
Follow a consistent data lifecycle when collecting data at different facilities
Streamline publication of EM data into open repositories like EMPIAR, EMDB, and the PDB
